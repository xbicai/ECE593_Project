# ECE593_Project
Term-long verification project for an Asynchronous FIFO for the ECE 593 - Pre-silicon Verification course at Portland State university. 
We are tasked with verifying a design of our choice using a variety of different methods such as a conventional testbench, a class-based testbench, and a UVM testbench. 

## Project Milestones as specified in the class.
**Milestone 1:**
- [x] Design Specification Document
- [x] Initial Verification Plan Document
- [x] Implementation of design and success compilation
- [x] Simple conventional testbench to test basic functionality

**Milestone 2:**
- [] Develop Class-based Testbench. All interfaces completed and tested
- [x] Completed transactions, Generator and Drivers, and other components
- [] Verified at least 20-50 randomized bursts of data.
- [] Update Verificaiton Plan with more detailed updates

**Milestone 3:**
- [] Finalize any changes in RTL
- [] Complete the class-based verification. All components must be defined and working
- - [] Transaction
- - [] Generator
- - [] Driver
- - [] Monitors
- - [] Scoreboard
- - [] Coverage
- [] Include both code and functional coverage reports
- [] Update Verification Plan

**Milestone 4:**
- [] Develop UVM testbench, starting with UVM TB architecture
- [] Add a section for UVM Verification plan and add details on UVM architecture, UVM hierarchy, UVM compoennts (sequence, sequencer, driver, monitor, scorebaord, interfaces with DUT< number of agents planned, etc.)
- [] Utilizing UVM_MESSAGING, UVM_LOGGING mechanisms to create and log the reports and data

## Asynchronous FIFO Buffer Design
Our design is based on a asnychronous fifo introduced in class with the following features. 


## Verification of the Design
### Convenetional Testbench
Status: Done

### Class-based Testbench
Status: In Progress

### UVM Testbench
Status: Not yet started
